For example, to load the 100th episode's session set `sess_path = './output/sess_100.ckpt'`. Otherwise, set `sess_path` to `None` to train from scratch. Currently, this script saves the session at the end of each [episode](#deqnparam).\n",
    "* The saved data starting point stores the an exogeneous shock and a capital distribution, which can be used to simulate states into the future from. If you have saved a starting point that you would like to reload, set `data_path` to the numpy data path.
